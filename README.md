# finance_utility
`finance_utiliy` is an in-house financial toolkit for portfolio management and trend-based analysis of securities. <mark>NOTE:</mark> For now it is only a loosely organized collection. Later on it will be made into a real package. 
## required packages

finance_utility requires:

 * python(>=3.8)
 * numpy(>=1.12.0)
 * matplotlib(>=3.5.0)
 * pandas(>=1.4.0)
 * [mplfinance](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance)
 * [pandas_market_calendars](https://github.com/rsheftel/pandas_market_calendars)

## Usage
Refer to scripts in `portfolio_manage` to assist in decisions related to general portfolio management.

Refer to scripts in `security_analyze` to assist in more aggressive bond and stock "investment", or rather, speculation.
<mark>WARNING:</mark> although the principles are generally suitable for all well-governed markets, the tools are tuned toward the security markets in China. If you plan to invest your hard-earned money in the USA/Japan/UK/Canada/South Korea markets in 2024+ or are stuck with them, then you must have too much money to play with, so I can only wish you good luck, I mean it seriously, you know what I mean.
